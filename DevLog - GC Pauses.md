# Garbage Collector pauses

The reason I am using C# over something like C++ or Rust is the DX.
It is much easier to program things in C# over Rust, and it is way easier to build things and manage dependencies in C# vs C++. 
Also reflection, it is really handy when you're writing a level editor for a game, or anything else where it may be convenient to know what fields and methods and properties a type has.

But, now I will have to spend the rest of eternity fighting with the garbage collector.





There is no pont being made here, that is all (for now at least, will update this later)
