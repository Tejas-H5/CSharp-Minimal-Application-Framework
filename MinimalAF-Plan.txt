[Final features] TODO:

FINAL Items :0		

	- [x] Fix audio implementation
	- [...] Get rendering utf8 text working
	
	-* Add way more unit tests 
		-* Things we haven't yet tested:
			- Font loading
			- Framebuffer postprocessing
			- ...

	-* Documentation. Auto-generate this from comments somehow, aint no body got time to write this. There is probably a nuget package somewhere that does this
	
	
Passive/as I go:
	-> switch back to _ notation, it was useuful to be able to see at a glance which variables are fields.
	
Backlog: 
	-* colour picker for the UI

	-* 3D lighting shaders
	
	-* stack-based opacity	

	-* Run arbitrary C# code	
	
	-* Python interop
		
	-* fix: implement Disposable for Audiosource since they are now pooled
	
	-* make stencil stack-based somehow
		- am not sure how possible this is.
	
	-* Try to understand how the depth is working, and why it doesnt work for 
	numbers greater than 1. Near far clipping planes?
	
Distant future:
	- feature: Some way to see the element tree in the test harness
		- Will need to be root-node-state based and done in AfterRender. Also figure out some way to move debug overlay to here as well	
		
	- feature: Add dynamic compilation (in general, not just test harness)
		-* find that ms doc page about c# dynamic compilation
