# Minimal Application Framework

Currently just for personal use, but it is a library that I will be using to make things in C#. 

Currently a Work in progress.

After making something, I will report back as to whether this was a giant waste of time or not ...

## Simplicity rewrite - TODO:

- Bug with KeyJustReleased(KeyCode.Any) - if a key is held, then it doesn't detect another key being pressed and released. Need to check if ANY key was pressed with a FOR-loop on all keys. Need to document that this is the behaviour.

- Review audio code, delete any bloat
